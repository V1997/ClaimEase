**ClaimEase: Automated Prior Authorization Form Filling System**

The project that most distinguishes me as an engineer is ClaimEase, an intelligent microservices system I built to automate Prior Authorization form filling for healthcare providers. This solved a critical problem where providers waste 2-4 hours manually transcribing patient data from referral documents into PA forms.

I designed a distributed architecture with five specialized microservices: OCR processing, NLP extraction, intelligent form filling, API orchestration, and asynchronous job management. The system uses Docker containerization, Redis message queues, and FastAPI for production scalability.

The most challenging aspect was systematic debugging of complex service interactions. When the pipeline failed, I didn't guessâ€”I instrumented every step using docker logs, redis-cli inspection, and structured logging. This methodical approach revealed that services were correctly mapping 27+ fields internally, but PDF output wasn't reflecting changes due to form library limitations.

My solution involved migrating from pdftk to PyMuPDF with coordinate-based filling, requiring deep understanding of PDF internals. I also solved cross-service data serialization issues by implementing standardized JSON handling and Redis configuration.

What distinguishes this work is the combination of system architecture, deep debugging skills, domain expertise in healthcare workflows, and production-quality implementation. The system achieves 95% time reduction and 80% error reduction while maintaining comprehensive documentation and technical decision logging.

This demonstrates end-to-end technical thinking that drives measurable business value.
